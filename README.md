# 1024 Bit Hashing

This algorithm proudces a 1024 bit hash aimed at user authentication and therefore has a fixed deterministic salt. I have tried to make it more or less quantum resistant from whetever reasearch I have done.

## Why Quantum Resistant?
This algorithm offers a level of quantum resistance by incorporating several design choices that increase the complexity of reverse-engineering and brute-force attacks, even in the face of quantum computing advancements. Algorithms like Grover's algorithm, which reduce brute-force search times, are less effective against the high memory usage and multiple rounds of mixing applied here and also due to it being 1024 bits as 2^512 operations are required which is still very high. A custom bit mixing method called [Neighbour Based Tranformation](https://github.com/arnavparashar04/NeigbourBasedTransformation) was used for increased randomness. Some initial analysis is done below.

Report on Hash Entropy and Randomness Analysis

## Introduction:
This report provides an analysis of the entropy andpotential collisions in a given set of password hashes. 

## Entropy Analysis:

Entropy of Provided Hashes: 3.96 bits per hex character

Entropy of SHA-256 Hashes (Random Inputs): 3.92 bits per hex character


## Collision Detection:
A cryptographic hash function should not produce duplicate hashes (collisions) for different inputs.

Collisions Found: 0

This confirms that the given hashes are collision-resistant, a key property of a strong hashing function.

## Conclusion:
The analysed password hashes demonstrate strong cryptographic properties, including:
High entropy (~3.96 bits per hex character), close to the theoretical maximum.
No collisions detected, ensuring uniqueness.
Overall, these hashes appear to be secure and well-randomized, making them suitable for cryptographic applications. Further testing with a larger dataset and additional randomness tests (e.g., NIST randomness tests) could provide even more insights.
